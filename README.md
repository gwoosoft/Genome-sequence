# Genome-sequence


New dataset source: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/splice/desc.html -> https://openml.org/d/46 for the
csv format
Using R programming, I perform exploratory analysis:
1. Probability distribution
2. Dataset Domain
3. Maximum and Minimum
4. Central tendencies
5. Measure of dispersion
6. Constant
7. Missing values and outliers
8. Data correlation between features


Using R programming, I work with individual classifiers:
1. Na√Øve Bayes
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Tree
4. Nearest Neighbor
